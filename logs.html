                <p><em>The stillness of the air would be strange for anywhere outside the Abyssal Garden. As it happens, neither wind nor weather occurs in this strange subspace. And in the midst of the timeless field sat the timeless one, his age far exceeding his childlike appearance and demeanor.</em></p>
                <p><em>He sat there, contemplating in silence. The memories, though crowded, remained fresh in his mind. The meetings, the decisions, the mistakes. Cruel reminders of crueler actions. After what seemed like an eternity, he spoke.</em></p>
                <p>"I…" his voice faltered for a second, "I didn't expect… to see you there." He spoke aloud. Only the slow beating of his own heart served as a response.</p>
                <p>"I didn't expect to see you at all, really." He swallowed, his saliva feeling like sand in his throat. "You were gone. They said you were gone."</p>
                <p>"You’re still gone." His eye stung, and he closed it. "I know that. Of course I know that. Because it's my fault."</p>
                <p>"If I weren't such a coward, if I could take these things into my own hands instead of standing on the sidelines and sending my friends to their deaths, something might have changed." He spat, his words dripping with a venom directed at none other than himself. "And even if nothing had, I could've said I tried. But I didn't."</p>
                <p>"I failed you. I failed her. I failed each and every one of them, because I was afraid and left everything in the hands of others. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."</p>
                <p>"But I don't want any forgiveness. I deserve nothing of that sort." His voice shook, as fragile as the silence around him. "Not when I have all this blood on my hands."</p>
                <p>"I'll atone. I'll make everything right again. I won't stand behind anyone, or make any sort of excuses. I'll see it to the end, and if I still have that right, I'll make you all proud."</p>
                <p>He stood up, brushed himself off, and opened his eye. "I swear it, in the name of Evoli Sigia. Because that's all I have now." And he declared this, voice clear and strong to the world, for nobody to hear.</p>
                <p>With the promise in his heart, Evoli stepped out of the Abyssal Garden. There was a job to be done.</p>

            <h2>Morning Patrol</h2>
            <p class="collapsible-drawer">&lt&lt Open &gt&gt</p>
            <blockquote class="collapsible-content">
                <p>It was late. Far too late for any sane, normal person to reasonably be awake. Unfortunately for Evoli, he was not a sane nor a normal person. As such, his body had deemed 3:27 AM as a reasonable time to get up and start its activities.</p>
                <p>Rubbing his eyes to focus them with one arm, he gently gripped the side of the bed with the other and pushed himself onto a standing position. The room rocked slightly, as though he were on an unsteady raft. That thought was puzzling to him, for Evoli could not remember a time he had ever been on a raft.</p>
                <p>Dismissing the thought, he walked out of the dorm room he had become so accustomed to once more. His eye, the one that wasn't hidden beneath a layer of thick bandages, darted about, surveying the hallways for any sign of life. Seeing that the coast was clear, Evoli continued moving, with the quiet gait of a sneaking predator.</p>
                <p>Downstairs, the kitchen and the connected living room were eerily quiet as well. That was to be expected, for the sleepless inhabitant of the dorms, Tunoku, had gone missing for what must have been the fourth or fifth time. A brief flutter of worry arose in Evoli's mind, but he squashed it firmly. Tunoku, even as an older model, was still a part of the combat robots made by the Kirijo Group: the Anti-Shadow Suppression Weapons. If Tunoku *did* finding himself in a situation he could not handle, it was unlikely that Evoli would be able to change anything.</p>
                <p>Evoli grabbed a couple of the brightly coloured stray pop cans littered about the kitchen, likely remnants of Aki's sugar-fueled rampage. A brief flash of inspiration flashed into his mind, the idea of a pop can launching cannon formulating in his mind. Finding the idea amusing, he stashed the aluminum cans into one of the various kitchen drawers for later, next to an assortment of spices.</p>
                <p>Brushing his hair aside, which was overdue for a trim, Evoli swiftly assembled a sandwich with the practiced precision of a professional. As he chewed on his newly made creation, he grabbed a coat with his sandwich-free hand and donned it before walking out of Iwatodai Dorms.</p>
                <p>It was a quiet day, Evoli noted as he took another bite, and it was as true as the oceans were blue, and equally obvious as well. The streets were lifeless, and Evoli thought that if the world were to end right then and there, he wouldn't notice.</p>
                <p>But it didn't, and so he continued walking. The cold of the winter chill felt as though a serpent of ice bit at him, sending a shiver through his body. Evoli did not heed the sensation, sweeping his gaze around his surroundings, alert to any threat that may reveal itself in the deep darkness of the newborn day. Evoli prided himself on his night vision; despite his poor eyesight on his right side, he wasn’t hindered much more than he was in the day.</p>
                <p>With the silence of the night (or perhaps morning to some) came thoughts. Initially, the thoughts were trivial, such as what kind of food one of the dorm’s inhabitants may cook for breakfast or what kind of music Shadows listen to. Then came the more intrusive thoughts. The mistakes that had been made, some recent and some not so recent. The years spent surrounded by white walls or neverending expanses of flower-speckled fields. People that had been lost, friends that could no longer be reached.</p>
                <p>Pushing the unwanted thoughts into the deeper recesses of his mind, he desperately searched for something else to ponder. Perhaps he should start a journal, he thought. But every time Evoli had tried to put his life onto paper, he’d forget to update it. The memory of Annabelle scolding him for leaving the various spiral notebooks strewn across the Abyssal Laboratory resurfaced, and he chuckled somberly. She had grabbed one, a circular book covered in glitter, and in a fit of rage, had slapped him with it far more forcefully than intended, sending him crashing into his desk. No matter how poor his memory was, watching Annabelle’s expression morph from outrage to panic and worry was as fresh in his mind as the flowers in that accursed Garden. He wouldn’t start a journal, Evoli decided, taking another bite of the sandwich. Being haunted would only add to his current problems, even if it was his best friend doing so.</p>
                <p>Evoli had cherished those times. Though he would never say it to their faces, he envied the family that Dai, Navi, Tunoku, Jinzo, and the others shared, odd as they were. They were oblivious to the times when he would observe them from the stairwell or from behind the beige couch in the living room to watch them go about their lives. Whenever they had caught him peeking, he merely played the act off as a prank or a joke.</p>
                <p>It was bittersweet. He was happy for them, truly, for familial bonds were something Evoli thought was beautiful. But it left a stinging, gnawing feeling of loneliness in his heart. The only people Evoli could call family was the small penguin, Peggo, and the odd biologically modified chicken-reptile hybrid, T-Rex. Though he was rather close to them, he often thought it was a little depressing how all of his friends were birds.</p>
                <p>Evoli frowned at the thought of Peggo, for the web-footed avian had not been seen for a while. Despite Evoli’s calls and searches, Peggo had not shown himself. It was worrisome, Evoli mused, but Peggo had always been an oddly resourceful bird that often got himself out of any situation, and the penguin’s sudden disappearances and reappearances were something he had grown accustomed to. So he decided not to worry.</p>
                <p>Small, needle pricks of cold brought Evoli out of his thoughts and back into the world. Specks of pure white had started to fall from the sky, slowly drifting their way to the ground. Evoli breathed out, and a pale mist appeared. He smiled, enjoying the sight. Despite the condition of the world, the snow still fell with the gentleness of a sleeping breath. Small joys such as winter snow were something that the rest of NEST underappreciated, but Evoli’s spirits were easily lifted.</p>
                <p>He waved his free hand through the air, and as if under command, the snow parted and fluttered about. Evoli took one last bite of his sandwich, finishing it off.</p>
                <p>Today would be a good day, Evoli thought, as he continued his morning patrol.</p>

            <h2>Old Hobby, New Project</h2>
            <p class="collapsible-drawer">&lt&lt Open &gt&gt</p>
            <blockquote class="collapsible-content">
                <p>Evoli stepped out of the busy Club Escapade, his mind moving at rapid speeds. The chat with Danu had brought some rather unpleasant memories to the surface of his mind. The youth hastily exited the eerily quiet Paulownia Mall, ducking into the building’s back alleys. Bringing a hand into his cloak, Evoli pulled out a crumpled sheet of blue paper and gently unfolded it.</p>
                <p>"Final Orgia," he read the title of the blueprints aloud, setting it onto the ground and tracing his finger along every bolded letter. "How very fond you are of the dramatics, Evoli Sigia." His mouth twisted into a wry smile as his hand moved, almost with a mind of its own, gently brushing against the meticulously drawn illustration of a weapon, though perhaps calling it something so simple was an understatement.</p>
                <p>No, it was a marvel of engineering, a superweapon utilising a hybrid of advanced mechanics and the power of Personas that could be called nothing short of a masterpiece born of Evoli’s incredible talent. "Though I'd abhor to use a pretentious term like 'masterpiece' on something so <em>wrong</em>."</p>
                <p>His hands shook, gently fluttering the paper they held. "It's such a cruel design, isn't it?" Evoli quietly whispered into the empty alley. "A weapon built to wring every last ounce of your soul in one big suicide bomb. You would to justify it too, you came up with a plethora of excuses to soothe your guilty conscience.</p>
                <p>"But <em>nothing</em> could justify this. You knew that too, deep down, and you continued. You committed an atrocity out of cowardice, one you'd regret for the rest of your life. You kept this blueprint on yourself for years, to remind yourself of those past mistakes. Are you really about to give it new use? Are you really going to put yourself in the same position as before?"</p>
                <p>The alley remained deafeningly silent, his questions unanswered. In his mind’s eye, Evoli saw, and he remembered. He saw a man consumed by flame and rage. He saw a woman abandoned for their affections. He saw a man being touched and shattered into glass and dust. He saw a woman tortured by the future. He saw the cause; those who paraded themselves as deities to be worshipped, yet had no cause for reverence besides power.</p>
                <p>Evoli put a shaking hand to his head. "No, not the exact same position. Things are different now. I'm different now. I had buried myself in regret and misery for so long. I was scared and insecure. But things have gotten far too precarious a long time ago for me to continue to sit back and do nothing.</p>
                <p>"Maybe this is another mistake. It doesn't matter. I'm not new to making mistakes."</p>
                <div class="rule-fade-in"></div>
                <p>The desk lamp—the only source of light in the room—flickered, and Evoli made a mental note to replace the lightbulb later. Grabbing a sheet of blue paper, Evoli began to sketch. His hands moved deftly above the paper with practiced precision, the years of sketching out similar plans evident in his movement. It was familiar, Evoli thought. It was like home, like he was back in the lab, working for days on end until he either collapsed or was forcefully “put to sleep.”</p>
                <p>Pushing the memories aside to focus on his work, he began muttering his thoughts aloud. "Weapons powerful enough to make gods flinch, harnessing the very soul. Using one of those faded Plumes of Dusk, I can convert electricity into soul energy. Though letting it lie around charged would be too volatile, meaning that it’d need to be charged up <em>during</em> the battle instead, and I'd need a powerful battery to hold the electricity in order to do that.</p>
                <p>“No, not just batteries, all of the parts needed for this kind of weapon would likely be extremely expensive. I <em>do</em> recall seeing some of the necessary parts in one of the trucks lying around, enough to likely make four or five weapons, though I’d prefer to keep this quiet with Hades around and I doubt the group would hand them over without questions, especially considering <em>my</em> track record.”</p>
                <p>Evoli pressed his index fingers to his temples in frustration. “Seriously, can’t they trust me even a little bit?! I mean, they have absolutely no reason to, in fact they’ve got more reason to do the opposite, but come on! A little bit of blind faith could go a long way!”</p>
                <p>Once he had vented his complaints, Evoli slumped back into the chair. “But even if I can get my hands on those robot parts, there’s still the rest of the items. Assuming I can make at least four weapons, I’d need to find four Faded Plumes, four elemental-attuned items, and if I want to make these <em>really</em> pack a punch, four Shadow Crystals. Not exactly the kind of thing you find lying around.”</p>
                <p>Turning his head, Evoli’s eye landed on four weapons, lying on a workbench to his right: a bow intricately carved of ice, a gun pulsing with heat energy once carried by a detective in the past, shards from the claws of a friendly yet occasionally feral beast, and a familiar spear humming with electricity.</p>
                <p>“These weapons use the elements I’m most familiar with. If I use these as a base, and add my own enhancements, I could probably make something pretty devastating…” he felt a chill as he spoke the last word, once more reminded of the last “devastating” weapon he had built.</p>
                <p>He shook his head, snapping himself out of another spiral. "No, no. Snap out of it, Evoli. I'm not building weapons out of fear anymore. I'm building them to protect. I’m building them to make sure that not even gods will be able to go unchecked."</p>
                <p>He looked towards his blueprints, half-finished projections of his mechanical genius. “But maybe they don’t need to be checked. I’ve been told time and time again to stay out of the business of gods. Maybe I’m interfering where I don’t belong. It’s not too late to stop here. Damn it, Evoli, can’t you make up your mind?!”</p>
                <p>The light of the lamp flickered once more, and went out, bringing Evoli out of his self-doubt-filled ranting. Feeling his accelerated heartbeat begin to slow, Evoli let out a tired breath. “I wonder what <em>she</em> would say right now?”</p>
                <p>Gently, Evoli rested his head on the table, cushioning it with his arms. “Probably what she always says, ‘just do what you think is right, y’know?’ She always wanted me to find the right thing to do on my own accord. Always so vague. I mean come on, that doesn’t help me at all…” Evoli smiled wistfully despite his words. “What I think is right…”</p>
                <p>Evoli raised his head. He turned to the weapons. He turned to the blueprints. He let out a long, exhausted sigh.</p>
                <p>“I’m going to need a lab.”</p>

            <h2>Fight Fire With Fire</h2>
            <p class="collapsible-drawer">&lt&lt Open &gt&gt</p>
            <blockquote class="collapsible-content">
                <p>Evoli placed the weapon on the table, gently wiping at the stray particles of metal and dust that had accumulated onto it. He admired the gun, forged using metals from the Underworld, with a mix of admiration and fear.</p>
                <p>It gently glowed, a white hue fighting against the dimness of the room. Streaks of faded blue lined its sides—the Faded Plume, integrated directly into the weapon itself, would act as a channel for both electricity and Soul Energy.</p>
                <p>“With the actual weapon done, what do I do with these?” He eyed the two objects on the table: the Fire Infusion Orb, which had been given to him by Mick at the cost of the weapon he took from a hero’s skeleton in the Underworld, and the Shadow Crystal, which he had quickly snatched from a small trophy case within the depths of Hades’ castle. </p>
                <p>He snorted as he recalled the act of larceny; his constant rapid-fire jabbering had almost bored the accompanying guard to tears as he trailed behind the group, scanning for anything that could possibly be useful. He had caught the crystal in the corner of his eye—a black octahedron sitting inside of a small glass display case, so dark that it seemed to draw in the light around it.</p>
                <p>“If what Mick told me is accurate, I need to infuse these using…” Evoli put a hand to his chin, stroking it in quiet contemplation as he recalled the extensive amount of information Mick had given him in the form of texts and disgruntled mutters.                 </p>
                <p>He picked up the weapon gently, carrying it with a delicacy not unlike how a mother would hold her newborn, and brought it into another room. There, a monolithic machine spanned the latter half of the room. Evoli eyed the two chambers on opposite sides of the machine, carefully setting the gun into the left chamber and the Fire Infusion Orb and Shadow Crystal into the right.</p>
                <p>“This was the machine they’d use to imbue the weapons on the ASSWs with the capability of taking down Shadows…” Evoli mused, recalling the thousands of pages he had flipped through as he scoured for any iota of information on the secret robotics projects of the Kirijo Ergonomics Lab. “Should be able to do the same for mine, even if my targets are a little more…higher calibre.”</p>
                <p>He pressed a couple of keys on the centre of the machine, nodding in confirmation as a display began spitting out information rapidly. Seemingly satisfied with what he was shown, Evoli grabbed a large switch, mulling over how similar this felt to Dr. Frankenstein awakening his monster, and pulled.</p>
                <p>A large flash engulfed the room, blinding the boy. As he rubbed the patches of stars out of his eye, he heard a <em>click</em> and the sound of steam as the doors to the individual compartments opened. He looked towards the right chamber, but nothing was there. His heart pounded in anticipation, and a sudden dizziness overtook him. Fighting through the waves of nausea, he turned his head to the left.</p>
                <p>In the left chamber lay his creation. Visually, nothing had changed, aside from the gentle glow of white taking on a deeper, ominous shade of crimson. But within his soul, Evoli felt something was wrong, as though he had created something that should truly have never seen the light of day. Every nerve in his brain, every cell in his body screamed against it, screamed to destroy it immediately—and it was a familiar sensation, one he had felt before a long time ago.</p>
                <p>He walked towards it, stared at it, touched it. It responded, as though it were almost living, connecting and bonding to his very soul, and Evoli knew it had chosen him as its wielder. He picked it up, felt its eerily emanating warmth, felt the terrible weight it had. He felt the power that he alone could command.</p>
                <p>And Evoli took a deep breath, steeling his nerves, as he pocketed the weapon.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>A Spark of Past Memory</h2>
            <p class="collapsible-drawer">&lt&lt Open &gt&gt</p>
            <blockquote class="collapsible-content">
                <p>The Lab hummed with activity. T-Rex had started diligently cleaning the various offices and workshops. Assisting him were his fellow feathered companions, Duche and Dodo, though with Dodo’s incompetence and Duche’s mischievous nature, they were more of a hindrance than of any actual use. Swarm had been given some sort of heroic task by the ruler of the Lab’s deeper levels, the Rat King (whatever that was), and had gone off to fulfill it, likely through the use of extreme, unnecessary violence.</p>
                <p>As the reptilian swept the floors with his usual vigour, he paused. The sound of muttering escaped through the closed workshop door, quiet enough to elude most people—but T-Rex was not most people. His primal regression came with a few neat perks, and one of those happened to be hypersensitive hearing.</p>
                <p>“—wasn't enough. Too much spread. Needs to be focused. Concentrated. Stronger. Can't fail again.” T-Rex frowned, or at least he did the closest expression he could with his reptilian features. He hadn't seen Lucien leave the workshop for days, and the door didn't have a pet entrance underneath it, so he couldn't even check up on the boy.</p>
                <p>"Lucien? Are you doing okay in there?" No response. The muttering continued as if he hadn't been heard at all. T-Rex sighed.</p>
                <p>"I hope Lucien is doing alright…"</p>
                <div class="rule-fade-in"></div>
                <p>The feverish roars of the audience were quiet in comparison to the bellows of the raging bull as he tore through the distance between him and his adversary. In his hands was a blade of cosmic power, glinting through the stadium lights, ever-so-slightly distorted as if it were cutting through space itself.</p>
                <p>One strike was all it took. The crowd descended into an intense, deafening pandaemonium. Evoli shuddered, his hand unconsciously drifting towards the holster on his belt.</p>
                <p>“The Arena really brings out the worst in people, huh?” Someone—Evoli could not identify them through the haze that had begun to settle in his mind—mentioned offhandedly, their voice barely audible through the cacophony.</p>
                <p><em>If it brings out the worst in us, does that mean that those parts were already there?</em> Evoli thought, but did not ask.</p>
                <p>Steam billowed out as the chamber door opened, crawling, licking the floor, screaming, disappearing into wisps. Instinctively, Evoli took a step back—once again, a familiar sense of dread crept up his spine, compounding and pressing down at him until he struggled to stand, grasping at his heart until it was about to burst. An eerie gleam of yellow pierced through the smoke, harsh and dreadful.</p>
                <p>A great spear, streaked with pale blue lining and crackling with energy infused into it by the Electrokinetic Artifact torn from Oumagatsu’s body. It was ever-so-slightly vibrating, as if it were incapable of holding the immense power within it.</p>
                <p>Though his mind screamed and recoiled with apprehension, Evoli reached out and grabbed the spear. The weapon greeted him with a light shock and paresthesia, pin-pricks and numbness spreading up his arm. It was light, impossibly so with its size and composition. He questioned, as he had so many times before, whether he should have made such a thing at all.</p>
                <p>All at once, exhaustion overwhelmed him as he sunk to the ground, the after-effects of his countless days of ceaseless work finally taking their toll. His eyelids felt as though they were made of lead as they closed, his mind shutting down at last.</p>
                <p>Evoli wondered whether the shivering was from the weapon or himself.</p>
                <div class="rule-fade-in"></div>
                <p>“So…what, he’s just gonna kill himself?” The girl’s hands trembled as her eyes glanced over the roughly sketched yet meticulously detailed blueprints for Final Orgia. “You’re just going to create life…create <em>sentient</em> life, and just…what…use it as a suicide bomb?”</p>
                <p>“It’s not a suicide bomb, Annabelle.”  The boy turned towards his desk, speaking with a quiet gravity. “It is a laser that channels all of one’s spiritual energy into a concentrated—”</p>
                <p>“Oh my god, that’s <em>not the issue</em> here!” Her frustration rising, Annabelle slammed the paper down in front of him, the force of the impact shaking the table and knocking various pens and documents off of it. “The issue, Evoli, is that you’re making someone kill themself! You’re creating actual, sentient life, and throwing it at something that you’re not even sure exists!”</p>
                <p>“I’m not uncertain.” Evoli snapped back, stooping down to collect the fallen objects. The stern command his voice held caused her to falter, if only for a moment. “I know he exists. I know he’s a threat. I know that this will stop him.”</p>
                <p>“You don’t <em>know</em> anything!” Grabbing his outstretched arm, Annabelle pushed him back into his seat, bringing his gaze up to meet hers. “You’re going off of a <em>feeling</em> that you felt coming off of the high of a battle! God, and you managed to drag me—”</p>
                <p>“It wasn’t a fucking <em>feeling</em>, it was an omen!” Evoli suddenly shouted. The wrath in his voice caused the girl to stumble back in shock, and Evoli got up from his seat, angrily smoothing the creases that her grip had left. “You weren’t <em>there</em> when we were dealing with Plantbat, <em>you're</em> the one that doesn’t know anything!”</p>
                <p>“Evoli…”</p>
                <p>“Look, I <em>know</em> I sound insane. I know it’s not much to go off of. But it’s not just a feeling, Annabelle, it was a warning. A feeling doesn’t come out of nowhere, doesn’t grip your heart so hard you think it might explode. It was the first time I have ever felt so…small.” His voice trailed off as he stared towards the floor, seeing something that wasn’t there. Annabelle looked away, her lips pressed tightly together.</p>
                <p>“I felt insignificant, like an ant about to be crushed underneath the heel of a being I couldn’t possibly begin to comprehend. I knew—I know that I’m dealing with something beyond me. Beyond any of us. A threat so cosmically beyond us that the only reason we’re still here is because we’re don’t matter to it. That’s why I have to do anything, absolutely <em>absolutely</em> I can in order to deal with this. It’s the *only* thing I can do!”</p>
                <p>“...But where do you draw the line, Evoli?” Annabelle stared into his weary eyes, direct and piercing. “How much are you willing to lose for this?”</p>
                <p>Evoli stared back at her, their gazes locked in a moment of conference that they alone could understand. Before he had even opened his mouth, Annabelle already knew his response.</p>
                <p>“Everything.”</p>
